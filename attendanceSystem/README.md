- It uses a PC's/Mac's **webcam** to get training dataset and classifies/predicts them in the **Real Time**. 
- Transfer Learning of MobileNet provides training accuracy on any model **>99.4%**. 
- Pre-requisites: **Web Server for Chrome** to locally deploy model to run on **any** browser.
- **Recommended Browser**: Chrome/Firefox
- Few lines of code modification makes can make it **Multi-Class Classifier**
