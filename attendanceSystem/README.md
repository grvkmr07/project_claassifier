## ***In brief words***😍:
Machine Learning model developed and deployed on a web browser focused to perform ***face recognition using classification*** technique.
- It uses a PC's/Mac's **webcam** to get training dataset and classifies/predicts them in the **Real Time**. 
- serves the purpose of face recognition quite effectively which may connected further to record attendace
- Transfer Learning of MobileNet provides training accuracy on any model **>99.4%**. 
- Pre-requisites: **Web Server for Chrome** to locally deploy model to run on **any** browser.
- **Recommended Browser**: Google Chrome, Mozilla FireFox
- You may download the weights learned and architecture of model trained, in the format **.bin** and **.json**
- Naive implementation of ***Google's Teachable Machine***
- credit for source idea and foundation of implementation goes to Lawrence Moroney, AI Lead at Google and his course in Coursera, Tensorflow Professional Developer Cerification.
- The codes have been re-written and hyperparameters have been differently tuned to have better performance of the model.
